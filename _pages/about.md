Hi, my name is Huicong. I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Washington and I'm now an EDG intern at MathWorks. I'm a mechanical engineer by training with a strong quantitative background and experience in interdisciplinary research, including computational and experimental fluid dynamics. I'm interested in full-stack web development, distributed systems and scientific computing. I enjoy working on challenging problems, exploring new technologies, and I am currently looking for software engineering internships for Fall 2021 and full-time roles for Summer 2022.
