Hi, my name is Huicong. I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I'm a mechanical engineer by training with a strong quantitative background and experience in interdisciplinary research, including computational and experimental fluid dynamics. I'm interested in scientific computing, distributed systems and web development. I enjoy working on challenging problems, exploring new technologies, and I am currently looking for software engineering internships for Summer 2021.
